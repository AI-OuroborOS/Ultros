Contributing
============

Thank you for considering contributing to Ultros. Whether it be pull requests,
bug reports, or fan art, all is appreciated. This document contains guidelines
to help make the process as easy and effective for everyone involved.


Core vs Contrib
----------------

There are two main parts to Ultros, the Core, and Contrib. All base
functionality goes in core (the base system and a few recommended modules), and
everything else goes in Contrib (e.g. extra plugins and protocols).
**TODO:** Improve this - see "structure" comment below

Bug Reports

**TODO:** This

Feature Requests
----------------

**TODO:** This

Pull Requests
-------------

**TODO:** This - mention branching, style (separate guide? PEP8, docstring
format), unit tests(?), git hooks (flake8)

**TODO:** We should probably document basic code structure somewhere - renamed
first section to "Structure" (both project and code structure)?
