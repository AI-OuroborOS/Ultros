# Ultros is able to use various different types of protocols.
# These protocols must all be based on Twisted's Protocols.
# Ultros ships with the "irc" protocol, for connecting via IRC.
# Developers may create their own Protocol objects for connecting to other services, such as Steam.

# Specify the names of the protocols to use for connections here.
protocols:
  - irc

# Any protocol-specific configuration goes in its own configuration file in the "protocols" folder.
# This will include connection information, so make sure you fill the file out!
