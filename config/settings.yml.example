# Ultros is able to use various different types of protocols.
# These protocols must all be based on Twisted's Protocols.
# Ultros ships with the "irc" and "mumble" protocols.
# Developers may create their own Protocol objects for connecting to other
# services, such as Steam or Teamspeak.

# Specify the names of the protocols to use for connections here.
protocols:
  - irc-esper

# Any protocol-specific configuration goes in its own configuration file in the
# "protocols" folder. This will include connection information, so make sure
# you fill the file out!
