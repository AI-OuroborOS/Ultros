Ultros - That squidoctopus bot thing
====================================

Ultros is a multi-protocol IRC bot designed from the ground up with
extensibility and ease-of-use in mind.

This site will serve as your usage documentation. We'll try to keep this up
to date, but please bear in mind that writing documentation is time-consuming
and that nobody on the team enjoys doing it.

Are you a developer? Maybe you're looking for the api_.

This documentation is **under heavy development** right now. If you get stuck,
please feel free to `join us on IRC`_ (**irc://irc.esper.net/Ultros**). Likewise,
if you use Ultros a lot and are good at writing documentation, come talk to us
or submit some pull requests. We'd appreciate it.
