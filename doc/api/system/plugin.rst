Plugin base class
=================

When you're writing a plugin, you will need to inherit this base class. Not
only is it in charge of setting up some plugins and defining standard functions,
but your plugin will actually fail to load if you don't inherit the Plugin class.

.. module:: system.plugin

.. autoclass:: PluginObject
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:
