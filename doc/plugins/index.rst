.. Ultros documentation on included plugins.

Plugins
=======

This section of the documentation will serve as your information on how
to set up and use the plugins that are included with Ultros. This does not
include the packages in the `contrib repo`_ - Go there for information on
those, as each package has its documentation in the repo for the time being.
