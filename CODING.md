This project follows the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
style guide for all Python code. Flake8 is run alongside other tests on our
CI server at every commit to ensure compliance, however, we do allow some leeway
on how strict the enforcement is - see below for a list of ignored Flake8 errors.

As [A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id10), 
the `# noqa` comment may be freely added to a line to skip validation where necessary
(for example, in Python code generated by Protobuf).

We recommend anyone committing code to setup a flake8 pre-commit hook.

### Ignored errors

* Errors from the `flake8` base package:
    * `E265`: Block comment should start with `# ` (That is to say, a space must follow the `#`).
    * `E402`: Module level import not at top of file.
    * `F403`: `from module import *` used; unable to detect undefined names .
    * `F841`: Local variable `name` is assigned to but never used.
    * `T000`: TODO note found.
* Errors from `flake8-docstrings` (PEP257), if installed:
    * `D200`: One-line docstring should fit on one line with quotes.
    * `D201`: No blank lines allowed before function docstring.
    * `D202`: No blank lines allowed after function docstring.
    * `D203`: One blank line required before class docstring.
    * `D204`: One blank line required after class docstring.
    * `D205`: One blank line required between summary and field description.
    * `D206`: Docstring should be indented with spaces, not tabs.
    * `D207`: Docstring is under-indented.
    * `D208`: Docstring is over-indented.
    * `D209`: Multi-line docstring closing quotes should be on a separate line.
    * `D210`: No whitespace allowed surrounding docstring text.
    * `D211`: No blank lines allowed before class docstring.
    * `D300`: Use `"""triple double quotes"""`.
    * `D301`: Use `r"""` if any backslashes in a docstring.
    * `D302`: Use `u"""` for Unicode docstrings.
    * `D400`: First line should end with a period.
    * `D401`: First line should be in imperative mood.

Structure

For a more complete understanding of any particular module, we suggest checking
out the API docs, or scanning over the source code, but below is a simple
high-level overview of the entire system.
